  Dynamic category filtering by difficulty

    We want the CategoriesContainer component to selectively put together its CategoryList UI variable depending on the state of the DifficultiesContainer component.  DifficultiesContainer will have single piece of state, an array that could be ['E','M','H'], ['E'], ['M','H'], etc.  When everything first loads, CategoriesContainer doesn't need to care about difficulties, can just render everything.  The trick is that when we change difficulty selections, thereby changing DifficultyContainer's state, we want CategoriesContainer to 'listen' for that change, and upon hearing it, update the categories accordingly.

    The game plan is for SetupContainer to keep track of two states from Difficulties and Categories.  Setup is the common ancestor of Difficulties and Categories, so we lift state up from Difficulties and Categories can render accordingly.  UPDATE: Success! Game plan worked as described.  To make things simpler, had to make difficulty labels consistent everywhere, so changed E, M, H to easy, medium, hard in database.  These labels then matched with class names for difficulty buttons, which helped a lot.  

  How to start a quiz

    There are plenty of specifics to work out here, but let's start at a high level.  The SetupContainer's state is gonna contain two chunks of data: 1. Object {selected category: number of questions}, 2. Array ['easy','medium'].  When 'Start Quiz' is clicked, these chunks are somehow brought along to our new location, QuizContainer or something like that.  On component mount, the data chunks are sent as parameters to the backend.  Backend does logic stuff and returns JSON of questions along with their answers and such.  QuizContainer manages some state like currentQuestion, which initializes to 1.  Also manages how user is doing on the quiz.  Can use state.currentQuestion to selectively display Question components.
